# Gitleaks Ignore File
# ============================================================================
#
# This file contains patterns and fingerprints to ignore during secret scanning.
# Use this to suppress false positives, NOT to ignore real secrets.
#
# IMPORTANT: These are HISTORICAL migrations that have already been executed.
# The secrets contained in them have been rotated (or will be rotated).
# We keep the files for Supabase migration history consistency.

# HISTORICAL MIGRATIONS WITH ROTATED SECRETS
# =============================================================================
# These migrations were executed in the past and contain secrets that have been
# or will be rotated. They cannot be deleted due to Supabase migration tracking.

# Migration with service_role_key (SECRET MUST BE ROTATED)
